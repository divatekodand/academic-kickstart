  description = """ Developed a Deep Learning based 3D object detection pipeline using LiDAR data.

  Key Features :

  * Developed point-cloud features using Graph Convolutions to improve detection of objects far from the Autonomous Vehicle.
  * Worked on reducing false positive detection rate. 
  * Worked on improving performance of proposed detection algorithm on rare classes.
  * Proposed an objective function to mitigate the effects of correlated point-cloud sweeps (non-independently and identically distributed data) on the detection algorithm.
