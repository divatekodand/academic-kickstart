title: "SerFer: Serverless Inference of Machine Learning Models"
subtitle: ""
summary: "With  the  advent  of  serverless  functions,  weâ€™re  seeing  moreand more applications trying to exploit the serverless domain.This can be attributed to three key benefits offered by server-less platforms:  1.  Functions can be triggered in response toevents,  i.e.   it  adopts  an  event  based  programming  model.2.  Provisioning and scalability issues are not the concern ofapplication.   3.   Serverless  platforms  adopt  the  pay-per-usemodel, hence preventing wastage of application resources ei-ther by provisioning too much and hurting budget or provi-sioning too less and hurting throughput and/or latency.  Ma-chine Learning inference is a throughput and latency sensitivedomain since it needs to be done in real-time.  Furthermore,such inference usually involves expensive computations.  Westudy the viability of doing such inference on serverless plat-forms.   In  doing  so,  we  also  characterize  when  it  would  besuitable to move from expensive GPU machines to serverlessplatforms."
