I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Madison looking for full time opportunities starting summer 2020. My research interests include Computer Vision, Deep Learning/Machine Learning and Perception in Autonomous Vehicles.

I'm particularly interested in applying Computer Vision to build robust Perception pipeline for autonomous vehicles. I interned at ARGO AI during summer 2019 where, I spent most of my time building Deep LiDAR pipeline (LiDAR based 3D object detection). Also, as a result of my internship, I gained knowledge about end-to-end perception, tracking, prediction and motion planning pipeline for autonomous vehicles. Additionally, I can fluently program in C, C++ and Python. Further, I have experience using Deep Learning frameworks (Tensorflow and Pytorch).
